					At UCSC, there are numerous on-campus basic needs facilities, but many
					remain underutilized due to confusion about what they offer and where
					theyâ€™re located. This app is here to change that. It provides a platform
					for these facilities to post their available products, along with an
					interactive map to help users easily find them. Additionally, the app
					leverages AI-powered image recognition to automatically identify and
					catalog the inventory in these facilities, making it easier for staff to
					itemize their offerings and for students to access up-to-date information
					about available resources.
